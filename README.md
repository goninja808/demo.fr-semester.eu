### Launch a development server

```
npx frontity dev
```

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


### Create a production-ready build

```
npx frontity build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

This will create a `/build` folder with a `server.js` (a [serverless function](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction)) file and a `/static` folder with all your javascript files and other assets.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

### Deploy as a serverless service

Upload your `static` folder to a CDN and your `server.js` file to a serverless service, like Vercel or Netlify.
